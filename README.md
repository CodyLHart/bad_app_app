[Trello Board - Planning](https://trello.com/b/9h6jCBzr/user-stories)

<h4>Next Steps:</h4>

  Create API for database of bad ideas for reference, becuase this will likely be useful to someone who has an idea but is unaware that it is bad.
  If a BadApp gets too many good votes, move app to an archive of good apps, or deleted from database.
